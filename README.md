# Steamforge Systems – Core UE4 C++ Codebase



Steamforge is a modular, systems-driven roleplaying game set in a grimy, gear-choked world where arcane steamcraft meets rusted industry and fractured empires. Designed with flexibility at its core, it blends high-concept world-building with hands-on survival, exploration, and community simulation. Players engage with a reactive environment shaped by a living time system, faction politics, and evolving NPC behaviors, all underpinned by a rich, expandable C++ backend meant to support both tabletop-style gameplay and video game integration.

The game world of Steamforge is populated with layered conflicts—between old magic and new machines, decaying nobility and rising guilds, human ambition and the echoing remnants of stranger things. From scavenging the haunted boiler-tunnels of a forgotten district to negotiating tense truces among war-hardened factions, every player action has weight. The modular design supports plug-in systems like a crafting framework, item logic, and dialogue engine, letting creators shape the kind of campaign or game loop they want.

At its heart, Steamforge is a game of survival, invention, and philosophical decay. Whether players are lone wanderers, city-state schemers, or part of an emergent society trying to rebuild from the cinders, they’re forced to contend with the rusted machinery of history grinding around them. Its tone evokes the literary density of Frank Herbert, the atmospheric grime of early industrial revolution fiction, and the creeping dread of Lovecraftian unknowns—mechanized and made flesh.
